About
~~~~~

DISim simulates various diffusion of innovation network models. 

It's first implementation is a reproduction of Abrahamson and Rosenkopf's
1997 Extent of Innovation Diffusion model [AR1997]_. 

The 1997 model contained 3 sets of simulations:
  1. Basic model of faddish diffusion (bandwagon pressure)
  2. Relaxes assumption of equal sensitivity to information creating bandwagon 
     pressure
  3. Model based on learning instead of fads

In the :doc:`modules` section, you will find the source code documentation and
links to stylized source code for easy reference and validation.
